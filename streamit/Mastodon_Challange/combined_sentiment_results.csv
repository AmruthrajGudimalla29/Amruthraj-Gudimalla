ThursdayFiveList,this week for thursdayfivelist loewe is putting on a t5lfestival and i can pick five of the acts performing i cant pick favourite current acts thats too difficult so im going to use magic festival powers to have five sets from artists that ive never seen and will never see  four because theyre no longer around and one contemporary band who come from very far away so lets head to the treadway stage and fire up the time machine   1 james brown circa 1970 during the early jbs era before bootsy fred and maceo left give it up or turnit a loose live in paris 1971  2 parliamentfunkadelic on the 197677 earth tourgive up the funk tear the roof off the sucker live in houston 1976  3 the specials circa 1980 when they had their strongest repertoire available but hadnt yet fallen apart concrete jungle live in liverpool 1980  4 sam  dave circa 1967  as with the specials this would be a window of the time when theyre at their best have the best songs to perform and havent yet turned against each otherwhen something is wrong with my baby on the 1967 staxvolt european tour  i think it might be the oslo gig as that was extensively filmed but im not certain   5 ak dan gwang chil adg7 who id like to see at any time they have some new music coming out and im hoping they might tour out this way however given theyre a korean shamanic folk supergroup who only intermittently work together the likelihood of them turning up in northeast england at any time is probably pretty slimwhatever live at glastonbury 2023,0.9601
